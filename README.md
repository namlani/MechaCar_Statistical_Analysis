# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Designed the following linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from a provided dataset in order to answer the below questions:

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
   - The vehicle length and the ground_clerance.
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
   - It is not consiered to be zero due to the effect the indepedent variables had on the dependent variable. A zero/near zero slope would only occur if the indepedent        variables have no effect.
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
   - Yes it is effective because, based on the R-squared value , the mpg of the MechaCar was predicted correctly 71 times.
